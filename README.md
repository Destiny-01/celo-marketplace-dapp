# Celo Marketplace DApp
This is a simple dapp built on the celo blockchain interacting with a nextjs frontend using celo composer that allows a simple CRUD and buying on the Alfajores Testner. [Link to the demo](https://celo-marketplace-dapp-react-app.vercel.app/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo and run `cd packages/react-app && yarn` commands in the root folder
2. Start the app by doing `yarn run dev` in the same terminal you used step 1 in
3. Open `localhost:3000` or whatever port shown in your terminal
4. Connect your wallet to the DApp (make sure you have some test celo and cUSD)
5. Click on add product, fill in the required details and create your product
6. Notice you can edit your product or delete it but can't do so on others not yours
7. Click the edit icon and edit your products, and it changes immediately
8. Click the delete icon and voila, it's gone
9. You can't buy your product, but can buy others...
10. Try buying a product

I hope you enjoyed the app and your feedbacks are most highly appreciated
