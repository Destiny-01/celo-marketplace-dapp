# Celo Marketplace DApp
This is a simple dapp built on the celo blockchain interacting with a nextjs frontend using celo composer that allows a simple CRUD and buying on the Alfajores Testnet. [Link to the demo](https://celo-marketplace-dapp-react-app.vercel.app/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the cloned repo folder in your terminal and run the commands one after the other:
    - `cd packages/react-app` - to navigate to the frontend of the dapp.
    - `yarn` - to install dependencies using Yarn (Please ensure you have yarn installed before preceeding, if not checkout [this link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) on how to activate/install it).
3. Start the app by running `yarn run dev` in the same terminal you used in step 2.
4. Open `localhost:3000` (or whatever port shown in your terminal) in your browser.
5. Connect your wallet to the DApp (make sure you have some test celo and cUSD)
6. Click on add product, fill in the required details and create your product
7. Notice you can edit your product or delete it but can't do so on others not yours
8. Click the edit icon and edit your products, and it changes immediately
9. Click the delete icon and voila, it's gone
10. You can't buy your product, but can buy others...
11. Try buying a product

I hope you enjoyed the app and your feedbacks are most highly appreciated
